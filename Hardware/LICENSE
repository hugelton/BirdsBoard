CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware
designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to
use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products
based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence
comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal
licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S
(strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only. Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement
by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any
involvement by CERN in their development.

1.  Definitions

1.1.  'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-S.

1.2.  'Compatible Licence' means:

    a)  any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or;

    b)  any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or;

    c)  any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which it
        applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S provided that on
        Conveyance of any such Source, or any associated Product You
        treat the Source in question as being licensed under
        CERN-OHL-S.

1.3.  'Source' means information such as design materials or digital
    code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to prepare
    a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its medium
    or how it is expressed. It may include Notices.

1.4.  'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available
    under this Licence.

1.5.  'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,
    whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
    application or processing of Covered Source.

1.6.  'Make' means to create or configure something, directly or
    indirectly, including by assembling components, fabricating,
    or processing Source.

1.7.  'Notice' means a notice, in the form specified in the Annex,
    that is included in, applied to, or conveyed with Covered Source
    or a Product.

1.8.  'Licensor' means any person or entity that makes Covered Source
    available under this Licence.

1.9.  'You' means any person or entity exercising rights under this
    Licence. 'Your' has a corresponding meaning.

1.10. 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.

1.11. 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make
    and test a Product, in the preferred form for modification.

1.12. 'Available Source' means Complete Source in the possession of
    the Licensor that is not Covered Source.

1.13. 'Source Location' means a location where a Licensor has placed
    Covered Source, and which is advertised to the public as the
    place where the Covered Source may be found.

2.  Applicability

2.1. This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveyance
    of Covered Source, and the Making and Conveying of Products. By
    exercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably
    accept these terms and conditions.

2.2. This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and
    Your rights under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon

    b)  cause the modified Covered Source to carry Notices stating that
        You have modified it, and giving the date of modification, and;

    c)  license the modified Covered Source under this Licence or a
        Compatible Licence, and;

    d)  if You add any functionality to the modified Covered Source that
        is not present in the original, provide a prominent notice in
        the modified Covered Source explaining the added functionality.

3.3. You may Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source in object
    code or executable form, provided that You also make its Complete
-   Source available under the terms of 3.1 and 3.2, in one of the
    following ways:

    a)  by accompanying it with the Complete Source in a physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, or;

    b)  by offering valid instructions on how to access the Complete
        Source from a Source Location.

4.  Making and Conveying Products

4.1. You may Make and Convey Products, provided that You ensure that

    with access to the Complete Source for the Product, in one of the
    following ways:

    a)  by accompanying the Product with the Complete Source in a
